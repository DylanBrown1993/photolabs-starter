# Photolabs

 This app allows users to browse through photos of multiple categories. Clicking on each photo will open a modal of the photo, providing users to see an enlarged view. They will also be able to see some similar photos to the one they have viewed.

 Photos can also be liked, which will toggle the notification in the top right of the page showing the user they currently have liked photos.
